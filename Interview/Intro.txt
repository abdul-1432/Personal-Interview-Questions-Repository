Hello and thank you for this opportunity.
My name is M.D Abdul Gafoor, and I'm currently in my final year at TKR College of Engineering and Technology. My family, consisting of my beloved mom, respected dad, and caring sister, forms the core of my support system.

Throughout my academic journey, I've donned multiple hats, exploring various domains such as Data Analysis, Data Science, Software Development (both front-end and back-end), and Data Engineering. I've gained practical experience through internships and apprenticeships, accumulating over 11 months of valuable insights at esteemed organizations like SDE-Walmart, Cognizant, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, LYFT, KPMG, TCS, and Excelerate.

My proficiency spans a wide array of technologies. In Fullstack, I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, NodeJS, BootStrap, SQL, MYSQL, and more. As a Data Analyst, I command SQL, PowerBI, Tabular, Excel, and PowerPoint. Additionally, I possess advanced skills in ML and AI, using languages such as C, Python, Core Java, Javascript, PHP, and others.

Beyond my academic commitments, I've independently undertaken several projects, including an E-commerce app, Bus Reservation System, Railway Reservation System, Spotify UI clone, and various others, showcasing my dedication and skills in action. As a freelancer for CULVET, I developed a Traveling website and Quiz app. Currently, I'm engrossed in building a Netflix Clone.

My GitHub profile, where I've completed 1K commits, and a LinkedIn network of over 4K followers reflect my active engagement and contribution to the tech community. I've earned certifications in my areas of expertise, and I'm continually expanding my knowledge through platforms like CodePen, Kaggle, freecodecamp, and AI tools such as ChatGPT, BlackBox, Google Bart, GitHub Copolite, and Bing.

Participating and winning in hackathons is not just a pastime but a testament to my problem-solving abilities. I've emerged victorious in events like KIMO, ACCIOSAT, and actively participated in FLIPKART GRID, SmartHackthon by Walmart, TCS hackathons, and more.

Attending workshops is a passion, with recent ones at IIT Hyderabad (Data Science) and IIIT Hyderabad (Social Networks). I'm not just seeking professional growth; I'm actively contributing to and shaping the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Why We Should Hire You?


"You should hire me for multiple reasons. First and foremost, my passion for software work culture aligns seamlessly with the values I've identified in your company. Through extensive research, I've concluded that your organization not only outshines its competitors like Deloitte and Accenture but also stands at the forefront of the tech industry.

I'm not a one-trick pony; I've got skills in different areas, wearing different hats in various domains. I believe in being versatile, and I think that kind of flexibility is crucial for your team.

In this AI era, I get that companies need to make some big moves. I'm all about embracing change, and I'm positive about being the cheerleader for that change. I'm organized, and I've got these non-tech skills like problem-solving and teamwork, which I believe are super important.

I've been on the job for 11 months, and trust me, that's something not many folks in my college can say. I've seen different work setups and handled some tough situations, always managing to pull through and get good results.

I'm not just about doing my thing; I know the value of teamwork. I'm confident that my mix of experience, skills, and team spirit make me a solid choice for the Software Development Engineer role here."

What is Your Salary expectation?

"Considering my diverse experience in various companies and industries, I'm aiming for a salary that reflects both my skills and the current market standards. During my internship, I earned a $500 intensive scholarship, showcasing my dedication and capability.

I see myself as an experienced fresher, having been exposed to different work environments. After thorough research, I've learned that your company typically offers a salary range of 4.2-17 LPA for this role. Based on my experience and the value I believe I can bring to the team, I would propose a range of 8.6-10.2 LPA. I feel this aligns with the industry standards and fairly compensates for my expertise and versatile domain knowledge.

I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to the team, and I believe this salary range reflects my commitment and the value I bring to the table."
